# A-Level-Computer-Science-Project

This is a repository backup of the latest copy I can find of my A Level Computer Science Project.
There were other later copies but the local copy this was taken from seems to be complete enough.
Either way, my school took the later copies for marking.

The premise of the project was to create a game in a programming language of your choice.
We as a class had been using Python but some members of the class used other languages for the project.

In my game, you play as a 'freelance doctor' that has been tasked with curing different locations from a viral infection
The aim of the game: Cure as many people as you can so that the infection is gone without losing too many to the infection.

To use:

- Clone the repo
- Open the .py file in a python editor (I used IDLE 3.7)
- Run the program.
